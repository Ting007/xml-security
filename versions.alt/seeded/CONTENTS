Original source code for versions of Apache XML-Security, unpacked and prepared
for compilation.

Directory 'common' contains libraries shared by multiple versions of
xml-security. This directory should be copied along with any vN directory
to ensure the subject will build correctly. Relative links to the common
directory have been set correctly as necessary.

The vN directories found here may include a file named "build.txt". This file
lists any modifications that were necessary to freeze dependencies and make that
particular version build successfully. The same changes will need to be made in
the event that you want to rebuild a version from a source tarball in the
originals directory.

To build a version, including its tests, execute 'build.sh compile' in
the base directory. (Versions v7 and v8, use 'build.sh compile.tests').

A collective JUnit test suite is already provided with each version, which
may be run directly with a test runner, as long as the classpath is set
correctly.  In the base directory is a script named "runTests.sh", which will
run the JUnit tests directly though JUnit. It expects as arguments the name of
the test runner to be used and any arguments to be passed to that test runner. Do
not include the name of the test suite as an argument. For example, to use the
regular text output test runner, you would issue the following command:
    runTests.sh junit.textui.TestRunner
To get a list of the test case names, you could issue this command:
    runTests.sh junit.textui.SelectiveTestRunner -names

This script is only intended to demonstrate how to set up the
classpath and run the test suite, it will likely need to be modified or
replaced to support automated testing.
