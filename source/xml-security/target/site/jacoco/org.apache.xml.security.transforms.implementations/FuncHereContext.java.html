/**
 * {@link FuncHereContext} extends {@link XPathContext} for supplying context
 * for the &lt;CODE&gt;here()&lt;/CODE&gt; function. The here() function needs to know
 * &lt;I&gt;where&lt;/I&gt; in an XML instance the XPath text string appeared. This can be
 * in {@link Text}, {@link Attr}ibutes and {@ProcessingInstrinction} nodes. The
 * correct node must be supplied to the constructor of {@link FuncHereContext}.
 * The supplied Node MUST contain the XPath which is to be executed.

 * Date: Tue, 21 Aug 2001 18:36:24 -0400
 *
 * &gt; My point is to say to get this baby to run, the XPath must have a
 * &gt; possibility to retrieve the information where itself occured in a
 * &gt; document.
 *
 * It sounds to me like you have to derive an XMLSigContext from the
 * XPathContext?
 *
 * &gt; and supplied the Node which contains the xpath string as &quot;owner&quot;. Question:
 * &gt; Is this the correct use of the owner object? It works, but I don't know
 * &gt; whether this is correct from the xalan-philosophy...
 *
 * Philosophically it's fine.  The owner is the TransformerImpl if XPath is
 * running under XSLT.  If it is not running under XSLT, it can be whatever
 * you want.
